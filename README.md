# Welcome to the CS7.2 Case Sorter Project

This project is an adaptation and upgrade of the [CS7.1 Case Sorter](https://github.com/sjseth/AI-Case-Sorter-CS7.1) project and features a number of improvements as well as a dedicated electronics package. It doesn't replace the CS7.1 solution which will still be available for the foreseeable solution but instead provides an easier route to building the AI Case Sorter for those who don't want to mess around with all the wiring and soldering required in CS7.1. 

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Choose your parts option:

If you are interested in building this project, there are two main options you can choose from. 

<font style="color:gold">**Option #1:**</font> Buy the full build kit which includes all the non-3d printed parts needed for the assembly. Choose this option if you are starting from scratch and only want to build one machine. This will usually be the cheapest option in this case. The complete build kit is available here: [CS7.2 Complete Build Kit](https://shop.sjseth.com/products/cs7-2-complete-build-kit).  **Note you will still need to provide your own 12v 5amp powersupply and a computer to run the software.* 

<font style="color:gold">**Option #2:** </font>Buy the essentials kit which includes only those parts which can be sourced from SJSeth Solutions. If you choose this route, you will need to referr to the [CS7.2 Parts List](https://www.reloadingrecipes.com/Partslist/Display/1) and acquire all the parts necessary for the build. The essentials kit can be purchase here: [CS7.2 Essentials Kit](https://shop.sjseth.com/products/cs7-2-essentials-kit)

### Step 2. Print the parts needed for your build:

This repo contains all the stl files needed to complete your build. Those files are organized by assembly and available in the [Models](./Models/) folder. For your convenience these "EZ Build" zip files have been created which have only the models which are needed/required for this project. This is to say, you just need to print everything in the zip. Refer to the assembly guides for the recommended filaments and print settings.

* [EZ Build for Essentials Kit](./Essentials%20Build.zip)

### Step 3. Assemble The Sorter

Refer to the instructions in the [Instructions Folder](./instructions/) for each of the assemblies.

* [Camera](./Instructions/CS7.2%20Camera%20Assembly%20Guide.pdf) (not needed if buying full kit)
* [Homing Sensor](./Instructions/CS7.2%20Homing%20Sensor%20Assembly%20Guide.pdf) (not needed if buying full kit)
* [Classifier](./Instructions/CS7.2%20Classifier%20Assembly%20Guide.pdf)
* [Sorter](./Instructions/CS7.2%20Sorter%20Assembly%20Guide.pdf)
* [Electronics Enclosure](./Instructions/CS7.2%20Electronics%20Box%20Assembly.pdf)



### Step 4. Install the software and read the manual
You need to register for an account to download the software. You can do this at [https://www.reloadingrecipes.com/HeadstampSorter](https://www.reloadingrecipes.com/HeadstampSorter). 

Here is the link to the latest software manual: [AI Headstamp Sorter Application Guide for v1.1.53](./Instructions/AI%20Headstamp%20Sorter%20Application%20Guide_11531.pdf)
